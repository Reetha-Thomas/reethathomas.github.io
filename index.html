      <h3>About Me</h3>
     <p>
    I am currently a <strong>Postdoctoral Fellow</strong> at the <em>Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (IIMB)</em>, specializing in climate modeling. I received my <strong>Ph.D. in Mathematics</strong> from the <em>Indian Institute of Information Technology Kottayam</em> in 2024 under the guidance of Dr. T. Bakkyaraj. My doctoral thesis, <strong>"Invariant Analysis and Exact Solutions of Certain Nonlinear Fractional Partial Differential and Differential-Difference Equations"</strong>, focused on the analytical and numerical treatment of nonlinear systems governed by fractional dynamics.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research expertise lies in <strong>nonlinear partial differential equations</strong>, with a strong emphasis on dynamical systems involving fractional and differential-difference equations. I have significantly contributed to the theoretical advancement of time-space fractional PDEs by extending analytical tools such as <strong>Lie Symmetry Analysis</strong> and the <strong>Invariant Subspace Method</strong>. Additionally, I have explored fuzzy differential equations and the mathematical modeling of <strong>SIRS-type epidemiological systems</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In recent years, I have expanded my focus to <strong>data-driven methodologies</strong>, particularly in integrating machine learning with mathematical modeling. I employ <strong>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)</strong> and <strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</strong> to solve complex nonlinear differential equations, enabling accurate and interpretable predictions in applications like air quality modeling and spatio-temporal climate data analysis. This interdisciplinary approach bridges advanced mathematical theory with cutting-edge machine learning techniques.
  </p>

  <h3>Education</h3>
  <p>
    I hold a <strong>Ph.D. in Mathematics</strong> from the <em>Indian Institute of Information Technology Kottayam</em> (2020–2024), where I worked under the guidance of Dr. T. Bakkyaraj. My coursework included <strong>Fractional Differential Equations</strong>, <strong>Lie Symmetry Analysis</strong>, <strong>Invariant Subspace Method</strong>, and <strong>Differential and Differential-Difference Equations</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to this, I completed an <strong>M.Phil. in Mathematics</strong> from <em>Bharathiar University, Coimbatore</em> (2017–2018), under the supervision of Dr. S. Narayanamoorthy. My M.Phil. thesis focused on the <strong>"Glucose-Insulin Regulatory Model Using Runge-Kutta and Homotopy Perturbation Methods in a Fuzzy Domain"</strong>, and my coursework covered <strong>Fuzzy Mathematics</strong>, <strong>Partial Differential Equations</strong>, <strong>Algebra</strong>, and <strong>Analysis</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also hold <strong>M.Sc.</strong> and <strong>B.Sc. degrees in Mathematics</strong> from <em>Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam</em>.
