                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (IIMB), specializing in climate modeling. My research expertise lies in nonlinear partial differential equations, particularly focusing on dynamical systems governed by fractional differential and differential-difference equations. I have made significant contributions to the study of time-space fractional partial differential equations, expanding key analytical techniques such as Lie Symmetry Analysis and the Invariant Subspace Method. These efforts have advanced the theoretical understanding of complex systems, while also paving the way for practical solutions to real-world problems.

                    Beyond my theoretical work, my research has extended into the realm of fuzzy differential equations and the mathematical modeling of SIRS (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible) epidemiological systems. This multidisciplinary approach has helped to bridge the gap between mathematical theory and applied fields, addressing critical challenges in health and climate systems. More recently, I have integrated advanced machine learning techniques into my research, focusing on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By merging deep learning with traditional mathematical models, I am enhancing the predictive capabilities of these models to solve complex, nonlinear differential equations with greater accuracy.

                    My academic journey began with my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mathematics from Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam, where I achieved top grades in both. I continued my studies with an M.Phil. in Mathematics from Bharathiar University, where I developed mathematical models for glucose-insulin regulation. My doctoral research, supervised by Dr. T. Bakkyaraj at the Indian Institute of Information Technology Kottayam, focused on invariant analysis and exact solutions of nonlinear fractional partial differential and differential-difference equations. My work blends foundational mathematical methods with emerging computational techniques, offering new insights into both abstract theory and applied research.
